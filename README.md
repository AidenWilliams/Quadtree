# Quadtree

This is a quadtree implementation for the CPS2004 unit in my University course.

The code is based off of [The Coding Train](https://www.youtube.com/user/shiffman) [github repository](https://github.com/CodingTrain/QuadTree). However I implemented the tree in CPP. I also provide the CMake text file and a number of tests. The schell scripts are intended to be run on Linux.
